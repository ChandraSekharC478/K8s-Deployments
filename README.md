# Docker vs Kubernetes

## Overview

This document provides a high-level comparison between **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, two key technologies in the world of containerization and orchestration.

---

## üê≥ Docker

**Docker** is a platform used to build, ship, and run applications in containers. It simplifies application deployment by packaging code and dependencies into a portable container image.

### Key Features:
- Lightweight and fast
- Platform-independent
- Easy to build and deploy containers
- Great for local development and testing

### Limitations:
- Manages containers **only on a single host**
- No built-in **auto-healing**
- No **auto-scaling**
- Lacks **service discovery and load balancing** across nodes
- Not designed for **enterprise-level orchestration**

---

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes (K8s)

**Kubernetes** is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across multiple nodes.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-host orchestration** (cluster-wide management)
- **Auto-healing**: Restarts crashed containers automatically
- **Auto-scaling**: Based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics
- **Service discovery and load balancing**
- **Rolling updates and rollbacks**
- **Persistent storage support**
- **Secrets and configuration management**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
